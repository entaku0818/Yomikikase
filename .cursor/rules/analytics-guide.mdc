# Analytics Implementation Guide

## Firebase Analytics Events

The app tracks subscription-related events using Firebase Analytics. All analytics logic is separated from the view layer and handled in the ViewModel.

### Tracked Events
- `subscription_purchase_success`: When a user successfully purchases a subscription
- `subscription_purchase_failed`: When a subscription purchase fails
- `subscription_restore_success`: When a user successfully restores their subscription
- `subscription_restore_failed`: When subscription restoration fails
- `subscription_plan_fetch_failed`: When fetching subscription plans fails
- `subscription_purchase_cancelled`: When user cancels a subscription purchase

### Localization
All analytics event names are localized in [locate/Localizable.xcstrings](mdc:locate/Localizable.xcstrings) to ensure consistent tracking across all supported languages.
